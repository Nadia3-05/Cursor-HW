    <h2>Plot summary</h2>
          <hr>
    <p>Trying to get the attention of the beautiful Gladys, Edward Malone asks his publisher to give him some "dangerous task". Editor McArdle commissioned him to interview the solitary and eccentric professor George Challenger. Malone's first meeting with the professor ends in a fight, however, Malone manages to gain Challenger's sympathy without filing a complaint with the police. The professor explains to the journalist the reason for his disagreement with the scientific world - once, during a trip to South America, a scientist found the body of a naturalist named Maple White in a small village. After examining the diary of the deceased, Challenger found that it contains sketches of a completely unexplored area, as well as dinosaurs next to people. Using the diary, the professor made a trip to the place, which the locals are very afraid of, considering it the home of the evil spirit Kurupuri, and discovered a giant plateau, where he shot an animal that turned out to be a prehistoric pterodactyl. He brought with him a lizard's wing and some photographs - rather weak evidence in favor of his theory.

        In reproach, he declares his readiness to make a second expedition with Professor Summerley and the traveler Lord John Roxton and Malone. Researchers are leaving for Brazil and have discovered a plateau, but this does not reduce Summerly's skepticism, which leads to a quarrel between scientists. The group manages to climb the cliff next to the plateau and knock down a tree on the other side. But soon travelers have to start a serious struggle for survival among carnivorous allosaurs (or megalosaurs), flying pterodactyls and ferocious apes - distant ancestors of man.
        
        After exploring the plateau of the expedition manages to go down. At a meeting at the Museum of Natural History, Challenger's associates confirm the professor's story, but now do not believe them. Then the professor demonstrates as evidence the live pterodactyl he caught on the plateau.</p>
